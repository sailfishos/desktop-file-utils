Description: |
    .desktop files are used to describe an application for inclusion in
    GNOME or KDE menus.  This package contains desktop-file-validate which
    checks whether a .desktop file complies with the specification at
    http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/, and desktop-file-install 
    which installs a desktop file to the standard directory, optionally 
    fixing it up in the process.
